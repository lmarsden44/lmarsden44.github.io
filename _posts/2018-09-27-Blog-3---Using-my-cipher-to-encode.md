  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>To evaluate my coding on the cipher.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To complete my cipher - make sure it's fully working.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes, It is all working perfectly now.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I kept trying different code till it finally worked, when it did I moved swiftly on the the next task.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I asked the teacher how to use the code I knew, and he explained to me what I was doing wrong.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I tried task two without asking questions - I managed to get somewhere with the code I already had.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I looked back on what I'd tried the lesson before.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I listened to the teacher’s explainations and understood them.</td>

    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to listen well to instructions given to me and use them to improve my shift cipher. This includes code given to me, instructions given on where the code should go, what tasks to complete in what order etc etc. I should have listened to the teacher’s first explaination, and then been able to understand it and grasp the task at hand quicker and easier.</td>

    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I will listen to instructions given when they are given, and use them to help my general learning on the task, being able to then apply code and advice given on the task. This will mean I then don’t have issues forgetting code and how to code.</td>
