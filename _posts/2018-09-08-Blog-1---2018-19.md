  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I found the blog making initially hard, but I managed to end up figuring it out by trying different ways to code things like the background.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I found the start a bit confusing, so asked a friend for some help.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I managed to use websites to find the code for background images, which let me make my blog look more professional. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I thought back to how I changed to about section on my last blog and then remembered how it worked.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I was listening to the teacher about how to find resources to help me. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>To improve, I could have taken notes as to what some useful bits of code or techniques were that I found. If I were straight onto the task too, I would've been able to do my background image in the time we had in the lesson. Also, I could have used the resources provided more often, as they did have everything I needed in them.</td>

    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I will have the resources site opened at all times, and Iâ€™ll be using it often for code for example for my tables, for the colour generator or maybe even for the grade boundaries. I also am going to buy a book to take notes of useful code I can use in future in. This will also help me memorise code and learn it for next time I have to reset my blog.</td>
