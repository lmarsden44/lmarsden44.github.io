    <td>Make an ASCII code translator that translates to and from ASCII.</td>

    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I persevered by looking into new code you can do on sheets that I wasn't aware of before.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I asked my friends how to change decimals to letters, helping me change to ASCII code.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I worked alone for the lesson majority, trying to focus on my work and no one else’s.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I looked back on my shift cipher code, and used that to help me make my new starter for ASCII code.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I listened to the teachers explanations and worked on the improvement points given to me to improve my new cipher.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I could've tried to make more progress in the lesson - I haven’t yet figured out how to make an ASCII code translator, but my aim for next lesson is to fully understand how to translate the code, that includes translating to AND from ASCII code. I think that I’ll need to look up new functions I can learn to use one google sheets to be able to translate to ASCII code. E.g. bin2dec (binary to decimal). Functions like these will enable me to go from letters, to decimals, to binary, and then to ASCII.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I will be looking up functions and trying to understand how all my code works, instead of just placing it in not understanding what it does. This will enable me to learn the code for lessons to come, and therefore I will be able to use it when necessary for future google sheets projects.</td>
